# Git example
This here is a repo for trying out git and github.

## What is Git?
Git is a **version control** software. It maintains different versions of our code/project as well as a history of our changes.

## What is a commit?
In git a commit is a checkpoint of the changes we made in our project. We can review all previous commits and revert back to any point in time we may want to. It's important to put clear commit messages, so you know what changes had occured there..

## What is a branch?
Branches are used to keep one section of code contained while also wanting to work on a new feature. It is a way to isolate code to keep them isolated. They are a different version of our code that comes from a  certain commit. Changes that occur on a seperate branch don't affect the main or any other branches. They are independant until they are merged into other branches.
